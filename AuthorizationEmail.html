<p>The Google Sheets add-on <i><?= ADDON_TITLE ?></i>is set to run
  automatically to refresh your data for
  <a href="<?= SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getUrl() ?>"
      target="_blank">this</a>
  spreadsheet. The add-on needs you to re-authorize it to run on your behalf.

<p>The add-on's automatic functions are temporarily disabled until you
  re-authorize it. To do so, open Google Sheets and run the add-on from the
  Add-ons menu. Alternatively, you can click this link to authorize it:

<p><a href="<?= url ?>">Re-authorize the add-on.</a>

<p>This notification email will be sent to you at most once per day until the
  add-on is re-authorized.
